              Hello! I'm Patrick, from the quote above. Fullstack Developer and
              Photographer. I started Meerkat Development as a creative agency
              combining my profession as developer with over a decade of
              experience as photographer. Web/Mobile Development and Photography
              have a lot in common, as they both require thorough planning
              processes to ensure that the end product comes as close as
              possible to the desired outcome. My skills in both fields allow me
              to craft solutions that reflect your brand and resonate with your
              clients.
              <br />
              Additionally, I have a huge passion for aesthetics and elegant yet
              simple designs that speak a powerful and strong language
              themselves.

                Wonder what it's like working with Meerkat Development?
              </span>{' '}
              <br />I find it extremely important to really understand what you
              as a client need. My goal is not to just sell my services, I
              rather aim to provide you with the satisfaction of you being happy
              with the final product. For that reason, I'll be very transparent
              and proactive throught the time we work together. And most
              importantly, you are always welcome to get in touch if you have
              questions.
